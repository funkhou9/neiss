# neiss

The neiss package provides access to all data (2009-2014) from the [National Electronic Injury Surveillance System](http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/), which is a sample of all accidents reported to emergency rooms in the US.

Inspired by [flowing data](http://flowingdata.com/2016/02/09/why-people-visit-the-emergency-room/).
